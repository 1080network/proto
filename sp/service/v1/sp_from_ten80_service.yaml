  title: "Service implemented by Service Providers"
  version: "0.1"
  description: >-
    <p>The operations in this service are called by 1080 to facilitate the user enrollment process
    at a Partner, to process transactions and optionally to retrieve a list of Users
    transactions. With the exception of RetrieveTransactions all the other operations are
    required.</p>
    <p>The two Funds operations, Obtain and Return, have basically the same structure and content.
    They primarily differ in the status codes they return. The main Funds type includes information
    about the instrument being used, the amount of the transaction (requested and total amounts),
    the currency, the organization and store the transation occured in and optionally a list of
    items the user is purchasing or returning.</p>
