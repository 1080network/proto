service:
  title: "Service called by Service Providers"
  version: "0.1"
  description: >-
    <p>The operations in this service allow the Service Provider to register their users and
    the user's instruments (accounts).  In addition there are operations to update, retrieve, search
    and delete those users and instruments. The SP can retrieve/search Organizations to retrieve
    information about them that is not passed via FundsObtain or FundsReturn. Finally the SP can
    provision it's own Payment Tokens which it can distribute to it's own users.</p>
    <p>The SP starts by authenticating themselves after which they can call the other operations in
    this service. At a minimum, the SP will need to call RegisterUser and RegisterInstrument for
    each user and instrument they want to make available for their users at 1080. For both Users and
    Instruments the SP can retrieve, update and remove them.</p>
    <p>When 1080 calls the SP with either FundsObtain or FundsReturn 1080 will include the
    organizationKey and the specific category being used for this request. If the SP wants to get
    more information about the organization (e.g. name, all categories, and it's address) they can
    use the GetOrganization and SearchOrganization calls.</p>
